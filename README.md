# GitOps-CD
## Rohan Raj Aggarwal

Git is a source of truth that stores all aspects of a project's infrastructure, including code files, configuration files, and application code files
Argo CD is a GitOps tool for Kubernetes that monitors the git repository and changes in the cluster. When it detects a difference between the desired state and the actual state, it syncs the cluster to match the desired state.
